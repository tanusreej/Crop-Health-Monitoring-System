		Abstract-Plant diseases are a major threat to farmers,
consumers, environment and the global economy. In India alone,
35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses
to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious
health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These
adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop
surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are
diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external
symptoms.</font></p><p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black"> However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our
project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for
automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers
can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions
with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Realtime
diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence
(AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model
continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert
suggestions to enhance its accuracy.</font></font></p><p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS" color="black"> Farmers can also interact
with local experts through the platform. For preventive
measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are
rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images
and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to
perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations.
